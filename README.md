## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model using Python.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the sentiment analysis model, run the following command:

```bash
python analyze_sentiment.py --input your_text_file.txt
```

Replace `your_text_file.txt` with the path to the text file you want to analyze.

## Notebooks

This project includes two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different aspects of sentiment analysis:

### main.ipynb

This notebook provides an introduction to sentiment analysis and walks through the process of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. It includes detailed explanations and code examples to help you understand the steps involved in building a sentiment analysis model.

### main1.ipynb

This notebook focuses on advanced techniques and fine-tuning the sentiment analysis model. It covers hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and performance optimization. The notebook also includes visualizations to help you interpret the results and improve the model's accuracy.
